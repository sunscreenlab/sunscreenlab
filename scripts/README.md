# sunscreen-submissions

This repository collects sunscreen submissions for review by the Sunscreen DNA project.

Submissions here represent user-provided claims about sunscreen products (e.g., ingredients, filters, regional availability).  
They are not automatically published and should not be considered verified or curated data.

## How submissions are used

1. A sunscreen is submitted via the Sunscreen DNA website.
2. The submission is created as an issue in this repository.
3. Each submission is manually reviewed for accuracy, sourcing, and consistency.
4. Approved entries are **manually added** to the canonical Sunscreen DNA dataset.

Only sunscreens that have been reviewed and approved appear on the public Sunscreen DNA site.

## What this repository is not

- Data in issues may be incomplete, incorrect, or outdated.
- Inclusion here does not imply endorsement or verification.
